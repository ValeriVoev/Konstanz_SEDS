## What is personalization? 

> the action of designing or producing something to meet someone's individual requirements.
**Oxford Online Dictionary**

<div class="double">
<p class="double-flow">
* Google searches
* FB feed
* Netflix recommendations
</p><p class="double-flow">
* Spotify recommendations
* Online shopping
* Your news website
</p>
</div>


## How is personalization achieved


Online content providers (online shops, social network platforms, streaming services) collect massive amounts of information about their user base - not only demographic and personal information, but also any interaction (click, like, post, etc) users have with the platform. 

We will work with an example for personalized movie recommendations based on the [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/1m/) database.


## The aim

We would like to be able to:

* Recommend new movies to existing users
* Recommend movies to new users as soon as they have rated at least one movie

To this end we will use an approach called **collaborative filtering**

* Collaborative - using preferences of many users
* Filtering - to predict (filter out) the items that a givem user might like

## Rating table

<table>
        <tr>
            <th scope="col"></th>
            <th style="text-align:center">Item 1</th>
            <th style="text-align:center">Item 2</th>
            <th style="text-align:center">Item 3</th>
            <th style="text-align:center">Item 4</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th scope="row">User 1</th>
            <td align = "center">  </td>
            <td align = "center"> 1 </td>
            <td align = "center">  </td>
            <td align = "center"> 5 </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th scope="row">User 2</th>
            <td align = "center">  </td>
            <td align = "center">  </td>
            <td align = "center"> 3 </td>
            <td align = "center">  </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th scope="row">User 3</th>
            <td align = "center">  </td>
            <td align = "center"> 4 </td>
            <td align = "center">  </td>
            <td align = "center">  </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th scope="row">User 4</th>
            <td align = "center"> 3 </td>
            <td align = "center">  </td>
            <td align = "center">  </td>
            <td align = "center">  </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th scope="row">User 5</th>
            <td align = "center">  </td>
            <td align = "center">  </td>
            <td align = "center"> 2 </td>
            <td align = "center">  </td>
        </tr>

... we will try to fill in the gaps

## Problem formulation

We will follow the exposition of "*Large-scale Parallel Collaborative Filtering for the Netflix Prize*" by Zhou et al.

* Denote the rating matrix by \( R \) of dimension \( n_u \times n_i \) where \(n_u\) is the number of users and \(n_i\) is the number of items. 
* An element \( r_{ij}\) represents the rating that user  \( i \) gave to item  \( j \) -- either a real number or missing.

___

We decompose the matrix \( R \) as 

\[ R_{(n_u \times n_i)} = U_{(n_u \times n_f)} V_{(n_f \times n_i)}, \]

where \( n_f \) is the number of latent factors (features). We will call \( U \) the user matrix and \( V \) - the item matrix.

Denote by \( \mathbf{u}_i \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{n_f} \) the \(i\)-th row of \( U \) and \( \mathbf{v}_j \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{n_f} \) the \(j\)-th column of \( V \).

With \( n_f \) large enough (relative to \( n_u \) and \( n_i \)) we can fit \( R \) perfectly, i.e., \( r_{ij} = <\mathbf{u}_i, \mathbf{v}_j>, \forall i, j \).

___

For very large \( n_u \) and \( n_i \), however, that would not be feasible (nor desirable - we will return to that a bit later), so in practice we minimize a mean-square loss function. For a single rating \(r\) the loss function is defined as

\[\mathcal{L}^2(r, \mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v}) = (r - <\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v}>)^2\].

## The data

* Users table

```{r}
users 
```
___

* Movies table
```{r}
movies
```

___

* Ratings table
```{r}
ratings
```
Data sparsity is `r scales::percent(1-nrow(ratings)/(nrow(users)*nrow(movies)))`.

## Top 5 movies
```{r}
ratings %>% group_by(MovieID) %>% 
	summarise(MeanRating = mean(Rating), nRatings = n()) %>%
	filter(nRatings >= 10) %>% 
	top_n(5, MeanRating) %>% 
	arrange(desc(MeanRating)) %>% 
	inner_join(movies)
```

## Bottom 5 movies
```{r}
ratings %>% group_by(MovieID) %>% 
	summarise(MeanRating = mean(Rating), nRatings = n()) %>%
	filter(nRatings >= 10) %>% 
	top_n(-5, MeanRating) %>% 
	arrange(MeanRating) %>% 
	inner_join(movies)
```


## A formula

\[ x_{1,2} = \frac{- b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]
